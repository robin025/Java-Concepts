# Tic Tac Toe GAME

- Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper and pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

- Tic-tac-toe is not a very challenging game for human beings. If you’re an enthusiast, you’ve probably moved from the  basic game to some variant like three dimensional  tic-tac-toe on a larger grid. If you sit down right now to play ordinary three-by-three tic-tac-toe with a friend, what will probably happen is that every game will come out a tie. Both you and your friend can probably play perfectly, never making a mistake that would allow your opponent to win. But can you describe how you know where to move each turn? Most of the time, you probably aren’t even aware of alternative possibilities; you just look at the board and instantly know where you want to move. That kind of instant knowledge is great for human beings, because it makes you a fast player. But it isn’t much help in writing a computer program. For that, you have to know very explicitly what your strategy is.
